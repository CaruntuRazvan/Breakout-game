# Breakout-game
This game simulates a breakout-type game in a window where bricks with the '#' symbol are generated at the top and can be destroyed when the ball hits them. The initial position is with the ball on the paddle; the paddle is centrally located, and the game starts when the 's' key is pressed. At the top of the screen, the score is displayed, which updates when the player successfully hits a brick. If the player lets the ball escape to the bottom of the screen, they lose, and a corresponding message is displayed. If the player destroys all the blocks, another appropriate message is displayed.
